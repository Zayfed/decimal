# decimal
s21_decimal is an educational project by School 21, aimed at implementing the decimal type in the C programming language. The standard C library does not provide a built-in decimal type, making this implementation particularly useful for financial calculations, where the rounding errors typical of floating-point arithmetic are unacceptable.
